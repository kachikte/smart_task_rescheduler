## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                    # Core business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/             # Data models (User, Project, Task)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/           # Business services (Auth, Storage, AI)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/              # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ features/               # Feature modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/               # Authentication feature
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ projects/           # Project management feature
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/              # Task management feature
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ai_assistant/       # AI integration feature
â””â”€â”€ shared/                 # Shared components
    â”œâ”€â”€ constants/          # App constants
    â”œâ”€â”€ theme/              # Theme configuration
    â””â”€â”€ widgets/            # Reusable widgets
```

### State Management
- **Riverpod**: Used for state management with providers
- **Hive**: Local database for offline data persistence
- **SharedPreferences**: For storing authentication tokens

### Key Technologies
- **Flutter 3.x**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **Riverpod**: State management solution
- **Hive**: NoSQL database for local storage
- **OpenAI API**: AI task generation (with mock fallback)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.x or higher
- Dart SDK 3.x or higher
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd smart_task_rescheduler
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy the `.env` file and update it with your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Generate code (if needed)**
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Configuration

#### OpenAI API Setup (Optional)
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Add it to your `.env` file
3. The app will use mock responses if no API key is provided

#### Mock Mode
The app works completely offline with mock data. No API key is required for basic functionality.

## Usage Guide

### Current Features
1. **Login Screen**: Enter email and password to sign in
2. **Form Validation**: Real-time validation of input fields
3. **Theme Support**: Automatic light/dark theme switching
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes

### Planned Features
- **Registration**: Create new user accounts
- **Dashboard**: Overview of projects and tasks
- **Project Management**: Create and manage projects
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and complete tasks
- **AI Assistant**: Generate tasks using natural language

## Development

### Code Generation
The app uses code generation for:
- Hive adapters (database models)
- JSON serialization
- Riverpod providers

Run code generation when you modify models:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Testing
Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web --release
```

## Project Structure

### Models
- **User**: Authentication and user profile data
- **Project**: Project information with color coding
- **Task**: Task details with priority and due date

### Services
- **AuthService**: Handles authentication and user management
- **StorageService**: Manages local data persistence
- **AIService**: Handles AI task generation and rescheduling

### Providers
- **AuthNotifier**: Manages authentication state
- **ProjectsNotifier**: Manages project data
- **TasksNotifier**: Manages task data
- **AIServiceNotifier**: Manages AI service state
